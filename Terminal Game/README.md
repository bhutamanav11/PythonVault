# 🪓 Hangman CLI Game – `word_guesser.py`

🎮 A fun terminal-based Hangman-style word guessing game made with Python!  
Guess the secret word one letter at a time before the hangman is complete. Packed with colorful output, difficulty levels, and a clean terminal vibe.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game picks a random 5-letter word.
- You choose your **difficulty**:
  - Easy → 8 attempts
  - Medium → 6 attempts (default)
  - Hard → 4 attempts
- Guess letters one by one.
- Wrong guesses draw the stick figure step by step.
- Win by guessing the entire word before you're out of attempts.
