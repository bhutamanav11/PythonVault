ðŸ§  NLP Practice Summary â€“ Codedex GenAI
This is a summary of all the hands-on tasks I completed during the Codedex GenAI NLP tutorial. I explored core NLP libraries and techniques using Python.

â¸»

âœ… Topics Covered
	1.	NLTK Basics

	â€¢	Installed and used nltk library
	â€¢	Downloaded required data packages like â€˜punktâ€™
	â€¢	Learned how to preprocess and clean raw text

â¸»

	2.	Tokenization

	â€¢	Used nltk.word_tokenize() to split sentences into words
	â€¢	Applied both sentence and word level tokenization
	â€¢	Practiced on multiple text examples

â¸»

	3.	N-Grams

	â€¢	Generated bigrams and trigrams using NLTK
	â€¢	Understood how N-grams are used in language modeling and text analysis

â¸»

	4.	Naive Bayes Text Classification

	â€¢	Used CountVectorizer to convert text into numeric features
	â€¢	Built Naive Bayes classifier using MultinomialNB
	â€¢	Classified text into categories like tech/non-tech and positive/negative
	â€¢	Measured model accuracy using accuracy_score

â¸»

	5.	Translation

	â€¢	Translated English text into Hindi and Gujarati
	â€¢	Used the translate library to experiment with multilingual outputs

â¸»

	6.	Text Correction with TextBlob

	â€¢	Used TextBlob to auto-correct spelling and basic grammar issues
	â€¢	Tested on sentences with typos and got accurate corrections

â¸»

	7.	Autocorrect Library

	â€¢	Used the autocorrect library to fix spelling errors
	â€¢	Applied it on noisy or intentionally misspelled sentences

â¸»

ðŸš€ Overall, I learned the foundations of Natural Language Processing with real code and hands-on experimentation.
This practice helped me build intuition for how text is tokenized, modeled, classified, translated, and corrected â€” which are all important for NLP-based applications.
