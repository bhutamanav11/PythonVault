## 🔍 What You'll Learn

✅ Core ML algorithms (SVM, Logistic/Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Linear Regression)  
✅ Real-world datasets (Iris, Digits, Sonar Rock vs Mine, etc.)  
✅ Preprocessing essentials (One-Hot Encoding, feature engineering)  
✅ Hyperparameter tuning (`C`, `gamma`, kernels, etc.)  
✅ Logic building through a fun terminal game

## 🚀 Projects Breakdown

### 🧠 `python_ml/` — Core Machine Learning

| Folder | Highlights |
|--------|------------|
| `Support Vector Machine` | Iris & Digit classification using `SVC` with kernel & parameter tuning |
| `NaiveBayes` | Probabilistic classification with GaussianNB |
| `decision_trees` | Tree-based model to classify structured data |

### 🎮 `Terminal Game/` — CLI Fun with Python

A self-coded terminal game (`word_guesser.py`) where:
- User guesses a hidden word in limited attempts
- Shows how control flow, loops, and strings can make mini-games
- Great for strengthening logic skills with fun 🕹️
