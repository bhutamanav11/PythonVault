This repo is like my Python lab. It has three main parts:

1. **Machine Learning Notebooks** – Where I practiced core ML algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Logistic and Linear Regression. All the basics are there with real datasets like Iris, Digits, and Sonar. I also added examples of one-hot encoding and tuning ML models.

2. **EDA Projects** – I’ve done a full exploratory data analysis on the Amazon Bestsellers dataset. It includes trends across years, genres, authors, prices, reviews, and even a custom score to rank books. Basically, I took raw data and turned it into visual insights.

3. **Terminal Game** – Just for fun and logic building, I made a word guessing game in Python that runs on the command line. It's basic but shows how to use loops, conditions, and strings in a real way.
